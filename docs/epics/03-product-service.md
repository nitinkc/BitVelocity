# Epic 3: Product Service

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive product catalog management service with full CRUD operations, data validation, and persistence layer for the e-commerce domain of the BitVelocity platform.

## Objective
Build a robust product service that manages the product catalog with proper data modeling, REST API endpoints, database migrations, validation, and comprehensive testing.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Product entity with audit fields is properly designed
- [ ] REST endpoints for CRUD operations are implemented
- [ ] Database migration scripts are created and tested
- [ ] Input validation and error handling work correctly
- [ ] Repository and service layer tests provide good coverage

## User Stories

### Story 3: As a user, I want to manage product catalog
**Epic:** Product Service  
**Story Points:** 18  
**Priority:** High  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Product entity includes all necessary fields with audit trail
- REST API supports Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Database schema is properly versioned with Flyway migrations
- Input validation prevents invalid data entry
- Error responses are consistent and informative
- Service layer is properly abstracted from data layer

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Design Product entity with audit fields
2. [ ] Implement REST endpoints (CRUD operations)
3. [ ] Add database migration scripts (Flyway)
4. [ ] Implement validation and error handling
5. [ ] Add repository and service layer tests

## Technical Requirements
- Spring Boot REST controllers
- JPA/Hibernate entity modeling
- Flyway database migrations
- Bean validation for input validation
- Service layer with business logic
- Repository layer with data access

## Data Model
Product entity should include:
- Basic product information (name, description, price, SKU)
- Categorization and taxonomy
- Inventory tracking fields
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
- Status and lifecycle management

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/products` - List products with pagination
- `GET /api/v1/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `POST /api/v1/products` - Create new product
- `PUT /api/v1/products/{id}` - Update existing product
- `DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}` - Delete product

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure Foundation epic (database setup)
- Authentication Service epic (for secured endpoints)
- Shared common library for audit fields
- Database (PostgreSQL) from local infrastructure

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All CRUD endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Validation rules are comprehensive and tested
- [ ] Repository tests cover data access scenarios
- [ ] Service tests cover business logic
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accurate
