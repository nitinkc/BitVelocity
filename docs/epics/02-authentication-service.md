# Epic 2: Authentication Service

## Overview
Implement a secure, JWT-based authentication service that provides centralized authentication and authorization for all BitVelocity platform services.

## Objective
Build a robust authentication system with JWT tokens, user management, password security, and role-based access control (RBAC) that serves as the foundation for platform security.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation is implemented
- [ ] User management endpoints are functional (register, login, refresh)
- [ ] Password hashing and validation meets security standards
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage is achieved

## User Stories

### Story 2: As a system, I need secure authentication for all services
**Epic:** Authentication Service  
**Story Points:** 21  
**Priority:** High  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JWT tokens are generated with proper claims and expiration
- User registration validates input and stores secure password hashes
- Login endpoint authenticates users and returns valid JWT tokens
- Token refresh mechanism works without requiring re-authentication
- RBAC system supports multiple roles and permissions
- All endpoints have proper error handling and validation

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
2. [ ] Create user management endpoints (register, login, refresh)
3. [ ] Add password hashing and validation
4. [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
5. [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Technical Requirements
- JWT library integration (e.g., jjwt for Java)
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- Database schema for users, roles, and permissions
- Security configuration for Spring Boot
- Integration with shared security library

## Security Considerations
- Passwords must be hashed using industry-standard algorithms
- JWT tokens should have appropriate expiration times
- Refresh tokens should be properly secured and rotated
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure Foundation epic (database setup)
- Shared security library from bv-security-core
- Database migration tooling (Flyway)
- Redis for session/token management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Security measures are in place and validated
- [ ] Integration tests cover all authentication flows
- [ ] Documentation includes API specifications
- [ ] Security review is completed and approved
