# Epic 1: Infrastructure Foundation

## Overview
Establish foundational infrastructure and development environment for the BitVelocity multi-domain distributed learning platform.

## Objective
Set up the core infrastructure components that will support all future development including monorepo structure, local development environment, shared libraries, and basic tooling.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Monorepo structure with shared libraries is established
- [ ] Local development environment (Kind + Docker Compose) is functional
- [ ] Developers can easily set up and run the platform locally
- [ ] Shared libraries are properly configured and reusable
- [ ] Documentation for development setup is complete

## User Stories

### Story 1: As a developer, I want a consistent development environment
**Epic:** Infrastructure Foundation  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** High  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Monorepo structure follows Maven parent POM pattern
- Shared libraries (common, events, security) are properly configured
- Docker Compose provides all required local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
- Kind cluster is configured for Kubernetes development
- Complete setup documentation is available

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Set up monorepo structure with Maven parent POM
2. [ ] Configure shared libraries (common, events, security)  
3. [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
4. [ ] Configure Kind cluster for Kubernetes development
5. [ ] Document local development setup

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) available
- Maven for Java build management
- Git submodules for component organization

## Technical Notes
- Follow existing repository patterns shown in submodules
- Align with current scripts/dev/start-infra.sh approach
- Leverage existing .gitmodules structure
- Build on existing CI/CD workflows in .github/workflows/

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks are completed
- [ ] Local environment can be set up with single script
- [ ] Services start successfully and are accessible
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed and approved
- [ ] Integration tests pass in local environment
