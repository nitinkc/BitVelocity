# Epic 4: Observability Foundation

## Overview
Establish comprehensive observability capabilities including metrics collection, structured logging, health monitoring, and alerting to ensure system reliability and operational visibility.

## Objective
Build foundational observability infrastructure that provides insights into system health, performance metrics, and operational status across all BitVelocity platform services.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection is configured and functional
- [ ] Structured logging with Logback provides detailed operational insights
- [ ] Health check endpoints are implemented for all services
- [ ] Basic Grafana dashboards display key metrics
- [ ] Alerting configuration is in place for critical failures

## User Stories

### Story 4: As an operator, I need visibility into system health
**Epic:** Observability Foundation  
**Story Points:** 16  
**Priority:** Medium  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Metrics are collected and exposed in Prometheus format
- Logs are structured and contain relevant context information
- Health checks provide detailed status of service dependencies
- Dashboards visualize key performance indicators
- Alerts are triggered for critical system issues

**Tasks:**
1. [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics collection
2. [ ] Set up structured logging with Logback
3. [ ] Add health check endpoints
4. [ ] Create basic Grafana dashboards
5. [ ] Configure alerting for critical failures

## Technical Requirements
- Micrometer for metrics collection
- Prometheus for metrics storage and scraping
- Logback with structured logging (JSON format)
- Spring Boot Actuator for health checks
- Grafana for visualization
- Basic alerting mechanism (Prometheus AlertManager)

## Metrics to Collect
- Application metrics (request rate, response time, error rate)
- JVM metrics (memory usage, garbage collection, thread count)
- Database metrics (connection pool, query performance)
- Custom business metrics (user registrations, product operations)

## Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- External service dependencies
- Disk space and memory utilization
- Application-specific health indicators

## Logging Standards
- Structured JSON format
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Appropriate log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Security considerations (no sensitive data in logs)

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure Foundation epic (Docker Compose setup)
- Authentication Service and Product Service for metrics sources
- Shared common library for logging utilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Metrics are being collected and displayed in Grafana
- [ ] Logs are structured and searchable
- [ ] Health checks return meaningful status information
- [ ] Dashboards provide operational insights
- [ ] Alerting is tested and functional
- [ ] Documentation covers observability setup and usage
