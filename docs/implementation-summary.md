   - Password security and RBAC
   - Comprehensive testing strategy

3. **Product Service** (`docs/epics/03-product-service.md`)
   - Product entity design with audit fields
   - REST API with full CRUD operations
   - Database migrations and validation
   - Repository and service layer implementation

4. **Observability Foundation** (`docs/epics/04-observability-foundation.md`)
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Structured logging with Logback
   - Health check endpoints
   - Grafana dashboards and alerting

### Issue Documentation

   - 13 story points across 5 tasks
   - Infrastructure setup and documentation

2. **Secure Authentication System** (`docs/issues/002-secure-authentication-system.md`)
   - 21 story points across 5 tasks
   - Complete authentication implementation

3. **Product Catalog Management** (`docs/issues/003-product-catalog-management.md`)
   - 18 story points across 5 tasks
   - Full product service implementation

4. **System Health Visibility** (`docs/issues/004-system-health-visibility.md`)
   - 16 story points across 5 tasks
   - Comprehensive monitoring setup

### GitHub Integration
1. **Issue Templates** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)
   - Epic template for high-level feature grouping
   - User story template for feature descriptions
   - Task template for specific development work

2. **Project Configuration** (`docs/project-configuration.md`)
   - GitHub Projects setup instructions
   - Label definitions and automation rules
   - Sprint planning guidelines

### Documentation Updates
1. **Sprint Overview** (`docs/sprint-1-overview.md`)
   - Complete epic and issue summary
   - Task breakdown and dependencies
   - Project board structure recommendations

2. **README.md Updates**
   - Added references to sprint planning documentation
   - Links to epic and issue documentation
   - Project configuration guidance

## Sprint 1 Metrics
- **Total Story Points:** 68
- **Number of Epics:** 4
- **Number of User Stories:** 4
- **Number of Tasks:** 20
- **Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks

## Key Features of the Implementation

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Each epic includes objectives, success criteria, and technical requirements
- Issues are broken down into specific, actionable tasks
- Clear dependencies and sequencing guidelines

### GitHub Integration Ready
- Issue templates align with agile development practices
- Project board configuration supports sprint planning
- Label system enables effective issue tracking

### Alignment with Repository Structure
- Leverages existing submodule organization
- Builds on current scripts and infrastructure
- Follows established patterns and conventions

### Security and Quality Focus
- Security considerations are explicitly documented
- Testing requirements are defined for each component
- Code quality and review processes are specified

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create GitHub Issues**
   - Use the provided templates to create epic and story issues
   - Apply appropriate labels and story point estimates
   - Set up project board with recommended structure

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Begin with Infrastructure Foundation epic
   - Follow the task sequence outlined in documentation
   - Use existing scripts as starting points

3. **Team Planning**
   - Review story point estimates with development team
   - Assign issues based on team capacity and expertise
   - Establish sprint cadence and review processes

### Future Considerations
- Sprint 2 planning based on Sprint 1 outcomes
- Integration with existing CI/CD workflows
- Expansion to additional domains (chat, IoT, social)
- Enhanced security and observability features
