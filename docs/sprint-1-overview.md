**Total Story Points:** 68

## Task Breakdown

### Infrastructure Foundation (13 points)
1. Set up monorepo structure with Maven parent POM (3 pts)
2. Configure shared libraries (common, events, security) (3 pts)
3. Set up Docker Compose for local services (2 pts)
4. Configure Kind cluster for Kubernetes development (3 pts)
5. Document local development setup (2 pts)

### Authentication Service (21 points)
1. Implement JWT token generation and validation (5 pts)
2. Create user management endpoints (4 pts)
3. Add password hashing and validation (3 pts)
4. Implement role-based access control (5 pts)
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests (4 pts)

### Product Service (18 points)
1. Design Product entity with audit fields (3 pts)
2. Implement REST endpoints (CRUD operations) (4 pts)
3. Add database migration scripts (Flyway) (2 pts)
4. Implement validation and error handling (4 pts)
5. Add repository and service layer tests (5 pts)

### Observability Foundation (16 points)
1. Configure Prometheus metrics collection (3 pts)
2. Set up structured logging with Logback (3 pts)
3. Add health check endpoints (4 pts)
4. Create basic Grafana dashboards (3 pts)
5. Configure alerting for critical failures (3 pts)

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Sprint 1 Recommended Sequence
1. **Infrastructure Foundation** - Must be completed first as it provides the foundation for all other work
2. **Authentication Service** - Should be completed early as other services will depend on it
3. **Product Service** - Can be developed in parallel with authentication after infrastructure is ready
4. **Observability Foundation** - Can be developed in parallel with other services

### Key Dependencies
- Authentication Service depends on Infrastructure Foundation (database, shared libraries)
- Product Service depends on Infrastructure Foundation and Authentication Service (for secured endpoints)
- Observability Foundation depends on having services to monitor (Authentication and Product services)

## GitHub Integration

### Issue Templates
The following GitHub issue templates have been created:
- [Epic Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/epic.md)
- [User Story Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md)
- [Task Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md)

### Labels
Recommended labels for issue management:
- `type:epic` - For epic-level issues
- `type:story` - For user story issues
- `type:task` - For specific development tasks
- `priority:high|medium|low` - Priority levels
- `epic:infrastructure-foundation` - Issues related to infrastructure epic
- `epic:authentication-service` - Issues related to authentication epic
- `epic:product-service` - Issues related to product service epic
- `epic:observability-foundation` - Issues related to observability epic

### Project Board Structure
Recommended columns for GitHub Projects:
1. **Backlog** - New issues awaiting triage
2. **Ready** - Issues ready to be worked on
3. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **Review** - Completed work awaiting review
5. **Done** - Completed and merged work

## Getting Started
1. Review the epic documents to understand the overall scope
2. Break down epics into GitHub issues using the provided templates
3. Set up project board with recommended structure
4. Assign story points and priorities based on team capacity
5. Begin with Infrastructure Foundation epic as the foundation for all other work

## Next Steps
After Sprint 1 completion, the following areas should be considered for Sprint 2:
- Orders service implementation
- Inventory service prototype
- Kafka event integration
- Redis caching implementation
- Enhanced security features
- Performance optimization
