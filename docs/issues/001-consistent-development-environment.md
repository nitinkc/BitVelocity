# Issue: Consistent Development Environment Setup

## Summary
As a developer, I want a consistent development environment so that I can quickly set up and contribute to the BitVelocity platform with minimal configuration overhead.

## Epic
Infrastructure Foundation

## Story Points
13

## Priority
High

## Description
Set up a comprehensive development environment that includes monorepo structure, shared libraries, local infrastructure services, and Kubernetes development capabilities. This will provide a foundation for all future development work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monorepo structure follows Maven parent POM pattern
- [ ] Shared libraries (common, events, security) are properly configured and reusable
- [ ] Docker Compose provides all required local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka)
- [ ] Kind cluster is configured for Kubernetes development and testing
- [ ] Complete setup documentation enables new developers to get started quickly

## Tasks

### Task 1: Set up monorepo structure with Maven parent POM
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Create a Maven parent POM that manages dependencies and build configuration for all modules in the monorepo.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parent POM defines common dependencies and versions
- Child modules inherit from parent configuration
- Build can be executed from root with `./mvnw clean verify`
- Dependency management is centralized and consistent

### Task 2: Configure shared libraries (common, events, security)
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Set up shared libraries that provide common functionality across all services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- bv-core-common library provides utility classes and shared models
- bv-event-core library provides event handling infrastructure
- bv-security-core library provides authentication and authorization utilities
- Libraries are properly versioned and can be consumed by other modules

### Task 3: Set up Docker Compose for local services
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 2 story points  

**Description:**
Create Docker Compose configuration for local development infrastructure services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PostgreSQL database is available with proper configuration
- Redis cache service is running and accessible
- Kafka message broker is configured with proper topics
- Services can be started with `./scripts/dev/start-infra.sh`
- Health checks ensure services are ready before application startup

### Task 4: Configure Kind cluster for Kubernetes development
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Set up Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) cluster for local Kubernetes development and testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Kind cluster can be created with consistent configuration
- Cluster includes necessary networking and storage setup
- Services can be deployed to local cluster for testing
- Integration with local Docker registry for image management

### Task 5: Document local development setup
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 2 story points  

**Description:**
Create comprehensive documentation for setting up and using the local development environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- README includes step-by-step setup instructions
- Prerequisites are clearly documented
- Troubleshooting guide covers common issues
- Developer workflow documentation is complete
- Examples show how to run and test services locally

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All tasks are completed and tested
- [ ] Local environment can be set up by new developers in under 30 minutes
- [ ] All services start successfully and are accessible
- [ ] Documentation has been reviewed and validated
- [ ] Integration tests pass in local environment

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose must be available
- Kind must be installable on development machines
- Existing submodule structure should be leveraged
