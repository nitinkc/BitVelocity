# Issue: System Health Visibility and Monitoring

## Summary
As an operator, I need visibility into system health so that I can monitor performance, diagnose issues, and ensure reliable operation of the BitVelocity platform.

## Epic
Observability Foundation

## Story Points
16

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Implement comprehensive observability infrastructure including metrics collection, structured logging, health monitoring, and visualization dashboards. This will provide operational visibility and enable proactive monitoring of system health.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics are collected and exposed in Prometheus format for scraping
- [ ] Logs are structured with JSON format and contain relevant context information
- [ ] Health checks provide detailed status of service dependencies and resources
- [ ] Dashboards visualize key performance indicators and system metrics
- [ ] Alerts are triggered for critical system issues and failures

## Tasks

### Task 1: Configure Prometheus metrics collection
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Set up Prometheus metrics collection using Micrometer and Spring Boot Actuator.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Micrometer dependency is configured for Prometheus registry
- Application metrics are exposed on `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint
- Custom business metrics are implemented for key operations
- JVM metrics (memory, GC, threads) are automatically collected
- Database connection pool metrics are exposed

### Task 2: Set up structured logging with Logback
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Configure structured logging with JSON format and correlation tracking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logback configuration outputs JSON-formatted logs
- Correlation IDs are generated and propagated across requests
- Log levels are properly configured for different environments
- Sensitive data is excluded from log output
- Log aggregation is compatible with centralized logging systems

### Task 3: Add health check endpoints
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

**Description:**
Implement comprehensive health checks for all service dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/actuator/health` endpoint provides overall health status
- Database connectivity health check with connection validation
- External service dependency health checks
- Custom health indicators for business-critical components
- Health check responses include detailed diagnostic information

### Task 4: Create basic Grafana dashboards
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Create Grafana dashboards to visualize key system metrics and performance indicators.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application performance dashboard (response times, throughput, errors)
- Infrastructure dashboard (JVM metrics, database connections)
- Business metrics dashboard (user registrations, product operations)
- Dashboards are version-controlled and deployable
- Proper time ranges and refresh intervals are configured

### Task 5: Configure alerting for critical failures
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Set up alerting rules for critical system failures and performance issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Prometheus AlertManager is configured
- Alert rules are defined for critical metrics (error rates, response times)
- Notification channels are configured (email, Slack, etc.)
- Alert escalation and routing policies are implemented
- Alert documentation includes runbooks for common issues

## Metrics to Collect

### Application Metrics
- HTTP request rate, duration, and error rate
- Database query performance and connection pool usage
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Business operation counts (products created, users registered)

### Infrastructure Metrics
- JVM memory usage, garbage collection metrics
- Thread pool utilization
- Disk space and I/O metrics
- Network connectivity and latency

### Custom Business Metrics
- User activity metrics
- Product catalog operations
- Service-to-service communication metrics
- Event processing rates

## Health Check Components
- Database connectivity (PostgreSQL)
- Cache connectivity (Redis)
- Message broker connectivity (Kafka)
- External service dependencies
- Disk space availability
- Memory utilization thresholds

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Metrics are being collected and visible in Prometheus
- [ ] Logs are structured and searchable in development environment
- [ ] Health checks return meaningful status information for all dependencies
- [ ] Grafana dashboards provide actionable operational insights
- [ ] Alerting is tested and functional with proper notification delivery
- [ ] Documentation covers observability setup, configuration, and usage

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure Foundation epic (Docker Compose with Prometheus/Grafana)
- Authentication Service and Product Service (as metric sources)
- Shared common library for logging utilities and correlation IDs

## Configuration Files
- `prometheus.yml` - Prometheus scraping configuration
- `grafana/dashboards/` - Dashboard definitions
- `logback-spring.xml` - Structured logging configuration
- `alert-rules.yml` - Prometheus alerting rules
