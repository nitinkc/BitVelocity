# Issue: Product Catalog Management System

## Summary
As a user, I want to manage product catalog so that I can create, view, update, and delete products in the e-commerce system efficiently and reliably.

## Epic
Product Service

## Story Points
18

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement a comprehensive product service with full CRUD operations, proper data modeling, database persistence, validation, and error handling. This service will manage the product catalog for the e-commerce domain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Product entity includes all necessary fields with proper audit trail
- [ ] REST API supports Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with proper HTTP methods
- [ ] Database schema is properly versioned with Flyway migrations
- [ ] Input validation prevents invalid data entry and provides clear feedback
- [ ] Error responses are consistent and informative across all endpoints
- [ ] Service layer is properly abstracted from data access layer

## Tasks

### Task 1: Design Product entity with audit fields
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Design and implement the Product entity with comprehensive fields and audit capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Product entity includes basic fields (name, description, price, SKU)
- Audit fields track creation and modification (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
- Proper JPA annotations for persistence
- Validation annotations for business rules
- Lifecycle management fields (status, active/inactive)

### Task 2: Implement REST endpoints (CRUD operations)
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

**Description:**
Create RESTful endpoints for all product management operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `GET /api/v1/products` - List products with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/v1/products/{id}` - Get product by ID
- `POST /api/v1/products` - Create new product
- `PUT /api/v1/products/{id}` - Update existing product
- `DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}` - Delete product (soft delete preferred)
- Proper HTTP status codes for all operations
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generated

### Task 3: Add database migration scripts (Flyway)
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 2 story points  

**Description:**
Create Flyway migration scripts for product database schema.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Initial migration creates products table with all required fields
- Indexes are created for performance optimization
- Foreign key constraints are properly defined
- Migration scripts are versioned and repeatable
- Rollback scripts are provided where applicable

### Task 4: Implement validation and error handling
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

**Description:**
Add comprehensive validation and error handling throughout the product service.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Bean validation annotations validate input data
- Custom validators for business rules (SKU uniqueness, price ranges)
- Global exception handler provides consistent error responses
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Validation errors include field-level details

### Task 5: Add repository and service layer tests
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  

**Description:**
Create comprehensive test coverage for repository and service layers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Repository tests use @DataJpaTest for data layer testing
- Service tests mock dependencies and test business logic
- Integration tests cover full endpoint functionality
- Test data builders provide realistic test scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions are thoroughly tested

## API Specification

### Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/products?page=0&size=20&sort=name` - Paginated product list
- `GET /api/v1/products/{id}` - Product details
- `POST /api/v1/products` - Create product
- `PUT /api/v1/products/{id}` - Update product
- `DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}` - Delete product

### Product Model
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "sku": "string",
  "price": "decimal",
  "category": "string",
  "status": "ACTIVE|INACTIVE",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp",
  "createdBy": "string",
  "updatedBy": "string"
}
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All CRUD endpoints are implemented and tested
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully in all environments
- [ ] Validation rules are comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] Repository tests cover data access scenarios
- [ ] Service tests cover business logic and edge cases
