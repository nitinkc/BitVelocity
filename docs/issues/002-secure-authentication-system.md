# Issue: Secure Authentication System Implementation

## Summary
As a system, I need secure authentication for all services so that user access is properly controlled and protected across the BitVelocity platform.

## Epic
Authentication Service

## Story Points
21

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement a comprehensive authentication service using JWT tokens, with user management capabilities, secure password handling, and role-based access control. This service will be the foundation for securing all platform services.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated with proper claims and expiration policies
- [ ] User registration validates input and stores secure password hashes
- [ ] Login endpoint authenticates users and returns valid JWT tokens
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism works without requiring re-authentication
- [ ] RBAC system supports multiple roles and permissions
- [ ] All endpoints have proper error handling and security validation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement JWT token generation and validation
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  

**Description:**
Create JWT token generation and validation functionality with proper security measures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JWT library is integrated (jjwt or similar)
- Tokens include necessary claims (user ID, roles, expiration)
- Token validation includes signature verification and expiration checks
- Proper key management for signing and verification
- Token blacklisting mechanism for logout/revocation

### Task 2: Create user management endpoints (register, login, refresh)
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

**Description:**
Implement REST endpoints for user registration, login, and token refresh operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` creates new user accounts
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` authenticates users and returns tokens
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` refreshes JWT tokens
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` invalidates tokens
- Input validation prevents malformed requests
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

### Task 3: Add password hashing and validation
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 3 story points  

**Description:**
Implement secure password hashing and validation using industry best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt or similar secure algorithm
- Salt is properly generated and used for each password
- Password validation includes strength requirements
- Old passwords cannot be recovered (one-way hashing)
- Password history is maintained to prevent reuse

### Task 4: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 5 story points  

**Description:**
Create RBAC system to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database schema supports users, roles, and permissions
- Role assignment and management functionality
- Permission checking mechanisms for endpoints
- Default roles (admin, user, etc.) are predefined
- Method-level security annotations work correctly

### Task 5: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Estimate:** 4 story points  

**Description:**
Create thorough test coverage for all authentication functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests cover all service and utility classes
- Integration tests cover full authentication flows
- Security tests validate token handling and access control
- Test data setup and teardown is automated
- Test coverage is at least 85% for authentication modules

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication endpoints are implemented and secured
- [ ] Security measures meet industry standards
- [ ] Integration tests cover all authentication flows
- [ ] API documentation is complete with examples
- [ ] Security review is completed and approved
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable response times

## Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Secure storage of refresh tokens
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak information
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure Foundation epic (database and infrastructure setup)
- Shared security library from bv-security-core submodule
- Database migration tooling (Flyway)
- Redis for session management and token blacklisting
