# High-Level Domain Design for Distributed Learning Platform

**Architecture Goal:** Modular, extensible, and ready for DB, observability, and ML/AI learning.

---

## 1. Domain Overview

### Domains:
- **E-Commerce**
- **Messaging/Chat**
- **IoT Device Management**
- **Social Media**
- **ML/AI Services**
- **Cross-Cutting Services** (Auth, API Gateway, Observability, Audit/Logging, Infra)

---

## 2. Communication Patterns (High-Level)

| From Domain      | To Domain(s)         | Protocols      | Typical Use Case                        | DB Strategy               |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| E-Commerce       | ML/AI, Analytics     | Kafka, NATS    | Order events, product recs              | OLTP (Postgres), OLAP (Mongo/Databricks); sharded orders in Cassandra |
| Messaging/Chat   | ML/AI, Analytics     | Kafka, NATS    | Chat events, sentiment, user activity   | Sharded chat logs, denorm user profiles (Mongo/Cassandra) |
| IoT Device Mgmt  | ML/AI, Analytics     | Kafka, NATS    | Telemetry, anomaly detection            | Partitioned telemetry DB (Cassandra/Mongo), device registry in Postgres |
| Social Media     | ML/AI, Analytics     | Kafka, NATS    | Posts, engagement stats                 | Denorm feeds, sharded comments (Mongo/Cassandra) |
| ML/AI Services   | All Domains          | REST, gRPC     | Model serving, feature store            | Analytical tables (Databricks), Redis (feature cache) |
| Cross-Cutting    | All Domains          | REST, Event    | Auth, API mgmt, observability, audit    | Central audit/log DB (Postgres/Mongo), Redis for sessions |

## 3. Domain-to-Domain Communication Diagram

- **E-Commerce** emits order/product events → **Kafka** → **ML/AI (recommendations, fraud, analytics)**
- **Messaging/Chat** emits chat/message events → **Kafka/NATS** → **Analytics, ML/AI (sentiment, moderation)**
- **IoT Device Mgmt** streams telemetry → **Kafka/NATS** → **Analytics, ML/AI (anomaly detection, predictive maintenance)**
- **Social Media** emits post/comment/feed events → **Kafka/NATS** → **ML/AI (content moderation, engagement analytics)**
- **All domains** consume model predictions via **REST/gRPC** from **ML/AI Services**
- **API Gateway (Apigee/Kong), Auth, Audit, Monitoring** are cross-cutting; all traffic passes through gateway, auth service issues tokens, observability collects traces/metrics/logs.

---

## 4. DB Design Guidance Per Domain

### E-Commerce
- **Transactional DB**: PostgreSQL (orders, payments, carts; ACID, audit fields)
- **NoSQL/OLAP DB**: MongoDB/Cassandra (product catalog, sharded/partitioned for scale)
- **Analytics**: Databricks for sales, product trends

### Messaging/Chat
- **Transactional DB**: PostgreSQL (users, notifications)
- **NoSQL**: Cassandra/MongoDB (sharded chat logs, denormalized profiles)
- **Analytics**: Databricks for sentiment, conversation analytics

### IoT Device Management
- **Transactional DB**: PostgreSQL (device registry, firmware updates)
- **NoSQL**: Cassandra/MongoDB (partitioned/sharded telemetry)
- **Analytics**: Databricks for anomaly detection

### Social Media
- **Transactional DB**: PostgreSQL (user, integration, audit)
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB/Cassandra (posts, comments, feeds; sharded, denormalized)
- **Analytics**: Databricks for engagement, content moderation

### ML/AI Services
- **Feature Store**: Redis/Cassandra (fast access to features)
- **Model Metadata/Results**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Training/Analytics**: Databricks

### Cross-Cutting Services
- **Audit/Logs**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB (centralized logging)
- **Caching**: Redis

## 5. Focused Learning Path

- Pick one domain (e.g., E-Commerce)
  - Implement CRUD, sharding/partitioning, denormalization, audit fields in DB.
  - Set up Kafka for event streaming, NATS for cross-domain events.
  - Integrate metrics/logs/traces for observability.
  - Connect to ML/AI Service for recommendations or analytics.

- Document each microservice’s API, DB schema (normalized/denormalized), event topics, observability hooks.

- Repeat for other domains.

---

## 6. Communication Example (Order Flow)

1. **Order placed in E-Commerce (PostgreSQL)**
2. **Order event sent to Kafka**
3. **ML/AI Service consumes event, predicts fraud/recommendation**
4. **Order status/event published to NATS for Analytics & Notification domains**
5. **Audit/Logging records all actions (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)**
6. **Observability monitors latency, error rates, trace flows (Prometheus/Grafana/ELK)**

---

## 7. Observability Integration

- All domains/services emit:
  - **Metrics** (Prometheus)
  - **Traces** (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger)
  - **Logs** (Elastic/Logstash)
- **Dashboards** show API, DB, event, ML pipeline health.

---

## 8. ML/AI Integration

- Data piped from all domains to Databricks for ETL, analytics, model training.
- Model endpoints available via REST/gRPC for predictions (recommendations, anomaly detection, moderation).

---

## 9. API Management

- Use **Apigee/Kong** for:
  - Rate limiting, security, analytics on public APIs.
  - Webhook management for integration and notification services.

---

## 10. High-Level Diagram (Textual Representation)

```
[E-Commerce]----|
[Messaging]-----|-> [Kafka/NATS] -> [ML/AI Services] <-> [Databricks]
[IoT Mgmt]------|
[Social Media]--|

All domains <-> [API Gateway] <-> [Auth] <-> [Audit/Observability]

[ML/AI Services] <-> [REST/gRPC] <-> All domains (for predictions)
```

---

## 11. Next Steps

- Choose first domain and DB setup.
- Document APIs, DB schema (with sharding/partitioning/audit).
- Set up initial event streaming and observability tooling.
- Plan integration with ML/AI and analytics for future stories.

**This design gives you clear separation, communication channels, and DB design for each domain—ensuring you won’t be surprised at the end. You can focus on one domain at a time and extend easily to others and to ML/AI!**
