# Security Coverage for Distributed Backend Learning Platform

## 1. Application-Level Security (Spring Boot/Java Focus)

### a) Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT**: Stateless token-based authentication for REST/gRPC.
- **OAuth2/OIDC**: Third-party and delegated authentication, e.g., Google, GitHub.
- **Spring Security**: Centralized security for microservices (RBAC, ABAC, method-level security).
- **Multi-tenancy**: Tenant-aware authentication/authorization.

### b) API Gateway Security
- **Apigee/Kong/Istio**: Rate limiting, API keys, IP whitelisting/blacklisting, request validation, CORS.
- **API Threat Protection**: Protect against API abuse (OWASP API Top 10).

### c) Protocol-specific Security
- **WebSockets**: Secure handshake, origin validation, token renewal.
- **gRPC**: Mutual TLS (mTLS), interceptors for authentication.
- **GraphQL**: Query depth limiting, complexity analysis, access control per resolver.
- **SOAP**: WS-Security, XML signature and encryption.

### d) Transport Security
- **HTTPS everywhere**: TLS termination at gateway/load balancer.
- **mTLS between microservices**: Secure service-to-service communication.

### e) Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Validation**: Bean validation (JSR-380), custom filters.
- **Sanitization**: Prevent XSS, SQL injection, command injection.

### f) Secrets Management
- **Spring Cloud Vault/HashiCorp Vault**: Store and retrieve secrets securely.
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Inject secrets into pods, avoid hardcoding.

### g) Secure Coding Practices
- **Static Analysis**: SpotBugs, SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check.
- **Code Reviews**: Automated checks for common vulnerabilities.

### h) Identity Federation & SSO
- **SAML, OIDC**: Integrate enterprise SSO solutions.

## 2. Cloud & Infrastructure Security

### a) IAM & Least Privilege
- **Cloud IAM roles**: Grant minimal required permissions for services.
- **Service Accounts**: Use per-service identities.

### b) Network Security
- **VPCs, Firewalls**: Restrict inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Private endpoints**: Internal-only APIs.
- **Multi-cluster security**: Secure inter-cluster communication (VPN, VPC peering).

### c) Container/Kubernetes Security
- **Pod Security Policies**: Limit capabilities, avoid privileged containers.
- **Network Policies**: Control pod-to-pod traffic.
- **Runtime Security**: Falco, Aqua, Sysdig for threat detection.
- **Image Scanning**: Trivy, Clair, Snyk for vulnerabilities.

### d) Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: DBs, storage buckets, message queues.
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS everywhere.
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS, Vault.

### e) Disaster Recovery & Backup Security
- **Backup encryption**
- **Secure restore procedures**
- **Immutable backups**

## 3. Monitoring & Incident Response

### a) Logging & Audit Trails
- **Centralized Logging**: ELK, Cloud Logging, audit logs.
- **Access Logs**: API gateway, DB, network.

### b) Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration**: Detect suspicious activity.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Alerting for abnormal patterns.

### c) Vulnerability Management
- **Continuous scanning**: CI/CD pipeline integrations.
- **Patch management**: Automated updates.

### d) Incident Response
- **Playbooks**: Automated response to detected threats (lock accounts, revoke tokens).
- **Forensics**: Audit trails, log retention.

## 4. Testing Security â€“ Practical Hands-On

- **Security Unit/Integration Tests**: Test authentication, authorization, and role enforcement.
- **API Security Tests**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Postman Security tests.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Jazzer, ZAP.
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks using open-source tools.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Simulate security incidents, e.g., credential leaks, network partition.

---

## 5. Additional Learning Use Cases

- **Account Takeover Prevention**: Rate limiting, IP reputation, password policies.
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Integrate basic MFA flows (TOTP, SMS, etc.).
- **Session Management**: Secure, scalable session handling (Spring Session, Redis-backed sessions).
- **Zero Trust Principles**: Every request authenticated and authorized, even within internal network.
- **API Security Posture Management**: Automated detection of exposed endpoints, unused APIs.

---

## 6. Modern Security Patterns

- **Sidecar Security (Istio Linkerd)**: Offload security features to service mesh.
- **Policy as Code**: Use OPA (Open Policy Agent) for dynamic, declarative policy enforcement.
- **Automated Secrets Rotation**: Periodic rotation and revocation of credentials.
